This is a classification model for a most common dataset, Credit Card defaulter prediction. Prediction of the next month credit card defaulter based on demographic and last six months behavioral data of customers.


## Technical Aspect
This project is divided into two part:
1. Training a [RandomForestClassifier](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.ensemble.RandomForestClassifier.html) classification model to predict defaulter as accurate as possible.
	- Cleaning the datasets, fixing all features
	- Apply Classification ML model
2. Building and hosting a Flask web app on Heroku.
	- Build the web app using Flask API
	- Upload the project on GitHub
    - Get the customer information from Web app
    - Display the prediction
